  # Per-arch native binaries pulled from the GitHub Release. The shas are
  # filled in by ./bin/update-shas.sh after each release tag is pushed and
  # CI has finished publishing tarballs. Until then this formula won't
  # install — that's intentional, brew will refuse rather than silently
  # downloading something that doesn't match.
